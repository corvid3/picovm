parallel handler:
	fd: int
	buf: []u8
	len: u16
	ptr: u16

P0 hardware interface:
	next:    0x00 OUT | BYTE
		writing a '1' bit to the `next` port will
		cause the `current` byte port to be updated with
		the next byte in the stream.
		if there are no bytes next in the stream, `current` is specified as 
		0xFFFF

	current: 0x01 IN | SHORT
		the current byte in the stream, advanced by writing to "next"

	enable_interrupts: OUT | 0x03
		enable hardware interrupts?

	interrupt_vector: OUT | i
